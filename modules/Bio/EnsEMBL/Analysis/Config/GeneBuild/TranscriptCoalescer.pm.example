Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::TranscriptCoalescer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::TranscriptCoalescer ; 
    Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::TranscriptCoalescer qw () ; 

=head1 DESCRIPTION


TranscriptCoalescer-Configuration 

This is the main configuration file for TranscriptCoalescer, a perl 
module which coalesces genes of different sources (EST-genes are 
combined with other EST-genes and Similarity-Genewise-genes or 
ab-initio-predictions (i.e. fgenesh, Genscan, GeneFinder ...) . 

TranscriptCoalescer fetches genes and prediction_transcripts by it's 
biotype (for Bio::EnsEMBL::Gene-objects) and by it's logic_name 
(for Bio::EnsEMBL::PredictionTranscript-objects). These biotypes/
logic_names are defiend in this configuration-file. Each biotype/
logic_name has to belong to a different evidence_set. (see below).

The parameters to connect to various databases are defined in 

  - modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/Databases.pm 
  - modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/Exonerate2Genes.pm  

The general function of this config file is to import  a number of 
standard global variables into the calling package. Without arguments 
all the standard variables are set, and with a list, only those variables 
whose names are provided are set.  The module will die if a variable 
which doesn\'t appear in its C<%Config> hash is asked to be set.

The variables can also be references to arrays or hashes.

Edit C<%Config> to add or alter variables.

All the variables are in capitals, so that they resemble environment
variables.
