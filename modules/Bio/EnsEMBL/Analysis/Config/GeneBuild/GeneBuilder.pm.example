Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::GeneBuilder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::GeneBuilder;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It imports and sets a number of standard global variables into the
calling package, which are used in many scripts in the human sequence
analysis system.  The variables are first declared using "use vars",
so that it can be used when "use strict" is in use in the calling
script.  Without arguments all the standard variables are set, and
with a list, only those variables whose names are provided are set.
The module will die if a variable which doesn\'t appear in its
C<%Config> hash is asked to be set.

Since The RunnableDB that this config controls how the genebuilder process is run and 
now several instances of the genebuilder can be run in the same pipeline this Config 
contains one primary config variable GENEBUILDER_CONFIG_BY_LOGIC. This is hash keyed 
off logic name, each entry of which is a hash containing the variable that affect the 
behaviour of the RunnableDB. When the RunnableDB instance is created, the correct 
entry is identified by logic name and value for a corresponding set of local variables 
are set.
