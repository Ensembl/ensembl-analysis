Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::BestTargetted

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::BestTargetted ; 
    Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::GeneBuild::BestTargetted qw () ; 

=head1 DESCRIPTION


BestTargetted-Configuration 

This is the configuration file for BestTargetted, a perl module which 
takes two sets of genes from different Targetted runs and generates a 
new set containing the best genes from the two input sets.

BestTargetted fetches the gene sets by analysis, the logic names are defined
in this configuration file. Pairs of overlapping genes are compared and
where different structures have been built from the same evidence the 
translations are compared. The protein index file which was used in 
the targetted run should be specified in this configuraion along with 
the path to the seqfetcher object.

If neither translation gives the same sequence as the evidence it was 
built from, Exonerate is used to assign a score to the alignment of
each translation to the evidence. The Exonerate program can be 
specified below othewise the default will be take from 
 - modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Runnable/BaseExonerate.pm
 
The parameters to connect to the databases are defined in 
  - Bio/EnsEMBL/Analysis/Config/GeneBuild/Databases.pm 
If no OUT_DB_NAME is given the output will be written to DB_NAME.

The general function of this config file is to import  a number of 
standard global variables into the calling package. Without arguments 
all the standard variables are set, and with a list, only those variables 
whose names are provided are set.  The module will die if a variable 
which doesn\'t appear in its C<%Config> hash is asked to be set.

The variables can also be references to arrays or hashes.

Edit C<%Config> to add or alter variables.

All the variables are in capitals, so that they resemble environment
variables.
