Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::AlignmentFilter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::AlignmentFilter;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It imports and sets a number of standard global variables into the
calling package, which are used in many scripts in the human sequence
analysis system.  The variables are first declared using "use vars",
so that it can be used when "use strict" is in use in the calling
script.  Without arguments all the standard variables are set, and
with a list, only those variables whose names are provided are set.
