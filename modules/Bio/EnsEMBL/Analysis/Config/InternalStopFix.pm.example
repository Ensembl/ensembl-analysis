=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::InternalStopFix

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Config::InternalStopFix;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    It imports and sets a number of standard global variables into the
    calling package, which are used in many scripts in the human sequence
    analysis system. The variables are first declared using "use vars", so
    that it can be used when "use strict" is in use in the calling script.
    Without arguments all the standard variables are set, and with a list,
    only those variables whose names are provided are set.

    This Config contains one primary config variable,
    INTERNALSTOP_FIX_CONFIG_BY_LOGIC. This is hash keyed off logic name,
    each entry of which is a hash containing the variable that affect
    the behaviour of the RunnableDB. When the RunnableDB instance is
    created, the correct entry is identified by logic name and value for a
    corresponding set of local variables are set.
