=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB::HiveRemoveDuplicateGenes - 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Get lincRNA candidate genes and break them down into single-transcript genes.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module collects the genes of a region, checks for overlaps, collapses overlapping models (with genebuilder) 
and writes back the genebuilder "unique" results. This module is usefull for lincRNA pipeline, it collapses
all RNAseq models of the different tissues. This is memory efficient and avoids doing the same calculations 
many times.
