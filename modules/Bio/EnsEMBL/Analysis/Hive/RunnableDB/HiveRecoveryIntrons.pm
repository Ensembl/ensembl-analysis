=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB::Bam2Introns

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $runnable =
    Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB::Bam2Introns->new(
    );

 $runnable->run;
 my @results = $runnable->output;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Takes an input id of a rough transcript and fetches reads associated with that model
from a BAM file, then runs a spliced exonerate alignment against genomic DNA or the
rough transcript. Writes output as SAM files.

=head1 APPENDIX

The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.
Internal methods are usually preceded with a _
