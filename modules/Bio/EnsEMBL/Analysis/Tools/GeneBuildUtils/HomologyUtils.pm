=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Tools::GeneBuildUtils::HomologyUtils - utilities for gene objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Tools::GeneBuildUtils::HomologyUtils qw(clone_Gene);

  or 

  use Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Tools::GeneBuildUtils::HomologyUtils
  
  to get all methods

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All methods in this class should take a Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::Homology
object as their first argument.

The methods provided should carry out some standard 
functionality for said objects such as printing info, and 
cloning
