=head1 NAME

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Tools::Algorithms::ClusterUtils;


  This package contains methods to make the GeneClusster easier to use.  

=head1 DESCRIPTION  



 Here's some ASCII art to understand this module better : 
 
   We will refer to 2 types of clusters in this module :  

    'one_way clusters'    - a cluster of genes [= genes which have overlapping exons ]
                            which contain only genes of one set 
                            use get_single_clusters method

    'two_way clusters'    - a cluster of genes [= genes which have overlapping exons ]
                            which contains genes of both sets, 
                            use get_twoway_clusters method

  Maybe it would have been better to call them one-set clusters and two-set clusters?



  'unclustered'         - these clusters contain genes which don't overlap any other gene 
                          in the same set, or in any other set. These genes are also known as 
                          non-clustering genes 



Example 1 :  

  This is a two-way cluster ( two-set cluster ) 
    - genes of 2 different sets overlap 

  SET 1 :          AAAAAAAAAAAA----------------AAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA       
  SET 1        BBBBBBBB------------------------BBBB 
  SET 2 :    ZZZZZZZZZZZ-----------------------------------------------ZZZZZZZZZZZZ



Example 2: 

  Below you see 2 one-way clustering clusters  (2-set-clusters)
    - both clusters are called 'one-way clustering clusters' - they only cluster 'one way'  - they are homogenous clusters...
    - no cluster contains a gene which belongs to a different set 
      method : #  get_oneway_clustering_genes_of_set($clustered,"transformed")

  SET 1 :          AAAAAAAAAAAA----------------AAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA       
  SET 1 :       BBBBBBBB------------------------BBBB 
  SET 2 :                                                                  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ----------------ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
  SET 2 :                                                                      YYYYYYYYYYYY


Example 3 : 

  All the genes below form one two-way cluster because the exons overlap : 

  SET 1 :          AAAAAA--------------------------------AAAAAAAAAAAA       
  SET 1 :       BBBBB                                                                                    BBBBBBBBBBBB-----------BBBBBBB
  SET 2 :                                                   ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ--------------ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ 



Example 4 : 

  The genes below are one-way-clustering : ( one set cluster ) 
      method : #  get_oneway_clustering_genes_of_set($clustered,"transformed")

  SET 1 :          AAAAAAAAAAAA----------------AAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAAAA       
  SET 1 :       BBBBBBBB------------------------BBBB 




Some definitions : 


    one-way clustering means : 
        - genes only have exon overlap within the same set, they only cluster among each other ('homogenous clusters')
          ( see Example 4 and Example 2 ) 

    two-way clustering means (=two set cluster )
       - the cluster contains genes of set A and set B, and the genes have exon overlap 
       -  example 1 and 3
