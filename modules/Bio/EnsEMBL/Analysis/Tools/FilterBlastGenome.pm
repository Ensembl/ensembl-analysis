=head1 NAME

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Tools::FilterBlastGenome

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $parser = Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Tools::FilterBlastGenome->
  new(
      -regex => '^\w+\s+(\w+)'
      -query_type => 'pep',
      -database_type => 'dna',
      -threshold_type => 'PVALUE',
      -threshold => 0.01,
     );
 my @results = @{$parser->parse_results('blast.out')};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a blast parser/filter that uses the protein sequence as the
query and the genome as the db.

              alignments overlapping higher coverage alignement of the
              same sequence
 Returntype : Hashref of String, the name of the sequences to keep

=head2 split_hsp

 Arg [1]    : Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Tools::BPlite::HSP, representing the region of
              genome where Arg[2] aligns
 Arg [2]    : String, name of the protein or dna sequence
 Description: Process the BLAST hit of a protein or dna sequence onto the genome by
              retrieving the alignment information from Arg[1], create multiple Bio::EnsEMBL::FeaturePair
              when there are gaps in the alignment to finally create Bio::EnsEMBL::BaseAlignFeature to
              be able to store the alignment in a database. The query and the subject are swapped to store
              the genomic location correctly.
 Returntype : Bio::EnsEMBL::BaseAlignFeature, either Bio::EnsEMBL::DnaPepAlignFeature or Bio::EnsEMBL::DnaDnaAlignFeature
 Exceptions : Throws if database_type and query_type is not either 1 and 1 or 1 and 3
              Throws if start is greater than end
