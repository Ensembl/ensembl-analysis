=head1 NAME

  Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB::ProteinAnnotation::Prodom

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $seg = Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::RunnableDB::ProteinAnnotation::Prodom->new ( -db      => $db,
	    	                                                                 -input_id   => $input_id,
                                                                                 -analysis   => $analysis,
                                                                               );
  $seg->fetch_input;  # gets sequence from DB
  $seg->run;
  $seg->output;
  $seg->write_output; # writes features to to DB

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  This object wraps Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Runnable::Prodom
  to add functionality to read and write to databases.
  A Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::DBSQL::DBAdaptor is required for database access (db).
  The query sequence is provided through the input_id.
  The appropriate Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis object
  must be passed for extraction of parameters.
