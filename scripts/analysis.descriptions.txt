ensembl, Genes were annotated by the Ensembl automatic analysis pipeline using either a GeneWise/Exonerate model from a database protein or a set of aligned cow cDNAs followed by an ORF prediction. GeneWise/Exonerate models are further combined with available aligned cDNAs to annotate UTRs (For more information see V.Curwen, Genome Res. 2004 14:942-50.)

estgene, ESTs are mapped on the genome using Exonerate (G. Slater et. al., BMC Bioinformatics. 2005 6:31), with a threshold of overall percentage identity of 90 and at least one exon having 97 or higher. The Cluster-Merge algorithm (E.Eyras et. al., Genome. Res. 2004 14:976-87) is used to infer a set of gene structures (including isoforms) from the alignments.
