# Script to parse gff3 files for clones. At the moment based off parsing NCBI clone db files
# but should work with any correctly formatted file. It is assumed currently that there is
# order in the file, i.e:
# clone_insert line
# clone_insert_start line
# clone_insert_end line
# The reason is that the clone name from the clone_insert line needs to be used with the start/end lines
# Might change this in future
