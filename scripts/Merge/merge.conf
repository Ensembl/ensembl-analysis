# Filter options.  You may specify either the X_include and X_exclude
# options, but not both.  These filter on gene analysis logic names.
# Any gene filtered out will not be found in the output database (i.e.
# they will also be skipped by the post-prosessing script that copies
# all unprocessed Ensembl genes to the output database).

## These are the defaults:
# ensembl_include=''
# ensembl_exclude=''

# havana_include=''

# Tagging:  Will be used as suffix for logic names ("_tag") and for
# source.  With the default settings, merged genes and transcripts will
# get the source "ensembl_havana".

## These are the defaults:
# ensembl_tag='ensembl'
