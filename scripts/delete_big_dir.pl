=head1 NAME

  delete_big_dir.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script take a single argument, the full path to a dir to remove and then removes all
files and subdirs before finally removing the dir itself. This is designed to remove very
complex subdir structures or dirs with a very large number of files in them. Perl is much
faster at this kind of task than rm or rsync to an empty dir
