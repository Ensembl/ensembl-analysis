=head1 NAME 

clean_kill_clip_cDNAs.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1

This script performs all the necessary clean-ups and checks on a cDNA file to
prepare it for genomic alignment (e.g. using exonerate est2genome model). It
outputs a cleaned cDNA file and also keeps track of cDNAs discarded in the
process (how many of them, which ones, and why).

=head2 The basic functions performed are:


(1) Header cleaning, leaving behind the ">" fasta sign and the cDNA accession
    (including version number).

(2) Removal of cDNAs which are below a length threshold (default = 60bp)

(3) Removal of RefSeq predicted sequences (accession IDs starting with "XM"
    and "XR".

(4) Removal of duplicated cDNAs in the input file, ensuring there's only one
    entry per cDNA accession ID.

=head2 The optional functions performed are:


(1) Removal of cDNAs which are present in the Ensembl kill_list DB.

(2) Clipping of polyA tail of cDNAs which have passed all the above checks
    (i.e. not too short, not RefSeq predicted sequence etc)


=head1 OPTIONS

=head1

=head2 Mandatory options

        -cdnafile       The input cDNA file to be processed in FASTA format
        -outfile        The output file containing cleaned cDNAs, also in FASTA
                        format.

=head2 Optional

        -min_length     The minimum length threshold for cDNAs, set at 60bp
                        by default. The cDNA shouldn't be shorter than this
                        length before or after polyA clipping, or else it
                        will be discarded

        -clip           Boolean flag indicating whether you want polyA
                        clipping on the cDNAs. Set to "no" by default

        -use_kill_list  Boolean flag indicating whether you want to check
                        each input cDNA against the Ensembl kill_list DB.
                        if a cDNA is present in the kill_list DB, it will
                        be discarded. Set to "no" by default.

        -verbose        If you want wordy output to follow the script.
                        Switched off by default.


=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Clean headers, check cDNAs against kill_list, min_length = 60bp, don't clip polyA:

  perl clean_kill_clip_cDNAs.pl -cdnafile my_input_cDNAs.fa  -outfile cleaned_cDNAs.fa\
    -min_length 60 -use_kill_list  >& cleaning_cDNAs.log

=head2 Clean headers, check cDNAs against kill_list, clip polyA, min_length = 60bp:

  perl clean_kill_clip_cDNAs.pl -cdnafile my_input_cDNAs.fa  -outfile cleaned_cDNAs.fa\
    -min_length 60 -use_kill_list -clip >& cleaning_cDNAs.log
