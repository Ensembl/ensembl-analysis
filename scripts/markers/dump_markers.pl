# Dumps markers from the marker table into a file, in the format expected by
# the EPCR Runnable

=head1 NAME

ensembl-analysis/scripts/markers/dump_markers.pl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

a script to dump the marker table out into a format for epcr

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script takes the entries from the marker table and dumps them out
in the format expected by the runnable Bio::EnsEMBL::Analysis::Runnable::EPCR
The file should be be pointed at by the dbfile column of the analysis table
for the analysis which is to run the EPCR

=head1 OPTIONS
    -dbhost    host name for database (gets put as host= in locator)

    -dbport    For RDBs, what port to connect to (port= in locator)

    -dbname    For RDBs, what name to connect to (dbname= in locator)

    -dbuser    For RDBs, what username to connect as (user= in locator)

    -dbpass    For RDBs, what password to use (pass= in locator)

    -outfile   the path to the file to dump the data into

    -help      prints out the perl docs

=head1 EXAMPLES

perl dump_markers -dbhost myhost -dbuser myuser -dbpass mypass -dbname
  mydatabase -dbport 3306 -outfile /path/to/epcr.marker.file
