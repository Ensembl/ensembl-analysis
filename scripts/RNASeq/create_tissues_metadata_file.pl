# This is a script which will create the delimited text file containing
# the summary data describing the RNASeq reads and tissues. This text file is 
# required for running the RNASeq pipeline. The output format is just an example as
# it could vary depending on how your data looks.
# Please, have a look at ensembl-analysis/scripts/RNASeq/README for further information.

# The usage is:
# create_tissues_metadata_file.pl bam_files_path description read_length paired output_file

# 'desc' will be the string for the DS (description) field
# 'bam_files_path', path to the directory where all of your bam files are located.
#       -Note that all of the bam files in this directory will be processed.
# 'read_length', assumed the same length for every read
# 'paired' can be either 0 (single end) or 1 (paired end).
#       -Note that this script only works correctly with paired end reads.
# 'output_file', path and filename where the text file contents will be written
#
# Example:
# perl $HOME/src/ensembl-analysis/scripts/RNASeq/create_tissues_metadata_file.pl $SCR/RNASeq/data/ "Canis Lupus familiaris" 101 1 $SCR/RNASeq/data/all_dog_tissues.txt
